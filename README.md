# CoffeBlog

CoffeBlog is a website dedicated to coffee enthusiasts. Here you will find delicious recipes, information about the benefits of coffee, and you can join our workshops to learn coffee extraction and roasting techniques. This project was created as a practice in web design and programming. The main objective is to apply modern techniques such as CSS Grid and Flexbox to develop a responsive and visually appealing design. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my skills in developing user interfaces that adapt optimally to a variety of devices and resolutions.
